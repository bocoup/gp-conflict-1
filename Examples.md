# examples of maps showing mobility

American Migration
http://www.forbes.com/special-report/2011/migration.html
- Looks interesting
- Like the connections
- Sometimes there are way too many (Middlesex County, Mass)
- Sometimes there are too few (Garfield County, Mont.)

Mobility Flow

- there's no origin, which we may want to highlight Syria as
- the coloring does make it easier to understand specific regions

Wind Motion Patterns

- obscures the map too much
- directionality doesn't make much sense in our case

World Migration
http://www.apowl.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vid_global_migration_datasheet_web-gimp3.png
- Very busy
- Hard to read
- Less applicable for a situation where one place is a source and many are a destination, I think
