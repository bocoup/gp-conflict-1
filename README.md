# Global Post: Conflict Piece #1
## Focusing on the Syrian Conflict and Refugee movement

Goal: Illuminate how bad the situation in Syria has become and how fast, focusing on the refugees.

## Getting things running:

`npm install`
`bower install`
`grunt dev`

Visit `http://localhost:8001`.

All the source is in the `app` directory.
The build files will go into `app/build`. That is also what will be on `gh-pages`. You can see things live here: http://bocoup.github.io/gp-conflict-1/

Warning! Things are still very much in flux, so this repo is likely to change a lot. 

## Notes from previous meetings:

About the story:
- ~5000 words
- There will be heavy use of photography and video
- focusing on the people affected, possibly broken down by categories like: Children (homelessness), Women (human trafficing), Men (militarization of).

Ideas for the visualization:
- Providing an overview is ok (rather than only focus on personal stories. It will be a good balance)
- Make it visually appealing so that people share it
- No need for a step-through guide unless there's anything particularly illumimnating to communicate
- Time is an interesting dimension to explore because of how fast it happened (~4 years)
- Other conflicts to possibly compare to: Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, WW2 (not sure if we have the data easily accessible?)
- Need to clearly record our sources and run them by Pete.
- The visualization will be embedded in the story but may also be pulled out into its own page.

Questions sent to Nick:
- Page framing - there's some feature page being built to house these that has more space and no ads. Need more details about that.
- Style guide requested for fonts and colors at least
- Browser compatibility
- Mobile requirements
- Delivery - a bunch of static assets ok? Integration on GP's side.
- Data as part of the code delivery?


Timeline:
- Publication Sept 15th
- Ideally have it to them before Sept 8th (need to check in with Nick about this.)
