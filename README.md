# Global Post: Conflict Piece #1
## Focusing on the Syrian Conflict and Refugee movement

Goal: Illuminate how bad the situation in Syria has become and how fast, focusing on the refugees.

## Getting things running:

`npm install`
`bower install`
`grunt dev`

Visit `http://localhost:8001`.

All the source is in the `app` directory.
The build files will go into `app/build`. That is also what will be on `gh-pages`. You can see things live here: http://bocoup.github.io/gp-conflict-1/*

Note you'll need the actual url to replace the *.
Currently available ones are:

http://bocoup.github.io/gp-conflict-1/syria.html
http://bocoup.github.io/gp-conflict-1/region.html

Warning! Things are still very much in flux, so this repo is likely to change a lot.

## Map Source

The maps are generated using a combination of:

* gdal
* topojson
* qgis
