      <h1>Fleeing the conflict in Syria</h1>
      <p>
        It all began with a small act of graffiti in March 2011. A group of young boys, no older than 15, tagged a wall in Dar'a, an ancient city in Syria's south, with the revolutionary slogans they had heard shout from their TVs in places like Cairo and Tunis. The Arab Spring was boiling. And Syria's secret police decided right then how it would go in Syria. They arrested the boys, who were tortured and beaten. Protests erupted. Today, more than four years later, some 250,000 are thought to have been killed, though most organizations keeping track of this have stopped keeping track of it. Below is the story not of who died, but who escaped.
