      <h1>The Burden</h1>
      <p>
        While Turkey has taken in by far the most Syrian refugees and asylum seekers, it is not necessarily Turkey that is under the most pressure. Turkey is much larger than Lebanon, and has a much stronger economy and a far more stable government. In Lebanon, the influx of Syrian refugees represents nearly a third of its population. That has put a strain on already high unemployment rates and the country's over-stretched government. As a result, many Syrians refugees are fending for themselves inside Lebanon, living in makeshift camps and begging for food and money. Conflicts between Syrians and Lebanese over land and jobs is increasingly common.
